# PixselX_Photography_Management_System
"PixselX" is the name of the photography management system which I've put into operation.
"PixselX.com" is the name of the photography management system that I put into place. Pages on PixselX.com can be static or dynamic. 
The clients may reserve the event date they want with our services easily using the system, which I also developed for, 
and this web application allows them cover their individual events with the preferred photographer. 
This approach also makes it easier for our clients to browse examples of our prior work and request a quote for their particular events. 
Another unique aspect of our online application is the opportunity we've provided for the enthusiastic, young community who are interested in photography to collaborate with us.
Both the Header and the Footer have been navigated using two navigators.I also place adverts for websites other than this one on social media platforms so that users can access 
this page through such advertisements.Utilizing Visual Studio Code as the development IDE and a MySQL database to hold data, the application was created utilizing 
the HTML,PHP and JavaScript programming languages.
